üìß Subject: Request for Proxy HAR Logging Access in Selenium Box
Hi [Security Team],

I am currently working on Selenium automation in Selenium Box and need to capture HAR (HTTP Archive) files to analyze network traffic for debugging and performance monitoring.

I noticed that our Selenium Box instances are configured with a proxy (proxy.pac) at:
üìç http://x.x.x.x:9140/e34_proxy/proxy/proxy.pac?p=x.x.x.x:9140

Since all browser traffic is routed through this proxy, I wanted to check if the proxy itself supports HAR logging.

üîπ Questions:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Does our proxy support HAR capture?

If yes, where are the logs stored, and how can I access them?
2Ô∏è‚É£ Is there an API or dashboard to retrieve HAR logs?

If the proxy logs requests, is there a way to download them for debugging?
3Ô∏è‚É£ If proxy HAR logging is not available, are there security restrictions on using a local intercepting proxy (e.g., BrowserMob Proxy) to capture network requests?

I‚Äôd like to explore alternative methods that align with security policies.
üîπ Why This Is Needed:
We need HAR files to debug network failures, track API responses, and measure performance bottlenecks in automated UI tests.
Instead of enabling Chrome DevTools (CDP) debugging, which might have security concerns, using proxy-based logging would be a secure alternative.
Please let me know how we can proceed while keeping security policies in mind.
I appreciate your guidance on this!
